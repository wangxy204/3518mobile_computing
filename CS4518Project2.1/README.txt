This is the extra credit of the homework.
There are two functions have been implenmented. 
1: Saving the picture when taking it. But you need to restart the photo app after take the photo. I don't know what's going on.:(
2: The swipe to delete function.
Those function are only implemented in the unpaied mode becuase I think there are only 4 photos you can take so the paid mode does not need this function.
