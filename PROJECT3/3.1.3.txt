The Firebase Realtime Database stores the data as JSON objects. In general the all the data stored in the Firebase Database is like JASON tree and it's different from the SQL database. In addition, all the detailed the data are stored by the identical keys as nodes. The best way to use this database is to struct the database as flat as possible so that we can reduce the iterating time of certain node or section in the database which is a waste of time. Furthermore, it will casue some secuity issues when we use a nested data structure because we can make sure that the data we granted to use is separated from other data and it may cuase safe issue. Then, we need to design the database to reduce the chance that we may have the two-way relationship of different kind of data. For the screen shot I have, there are two sub sets in the channels because I clicked the books and game channel. In the book channel I typed "Hello", in the game channel I typed "PUBG" and you can see the diplay name is my google account.Time under the key is the time I sent the message. In the inbox section, the number showed under the inbox is the number of client like ID. Under the Id of the client is the log of current client, as you can see: I sign in and switch to the channel book and then switched to the game channel.
