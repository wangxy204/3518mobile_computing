I only finished all the 3.1, 3.2.1 and 3.2.2.
This application can take no more than 4 photos in unpay mode, and the pay button is in the righttop item list. When you click the pay button, all the crime will change to the pay mode. For the 3.1, the user can replace the picture by clicking the photo. For the 3.2, I only finished the first and the second part. The videos are in the video folder. About the implementation of 3.2, I basically got the idea from the recyclerview in the CrimeListRecyclerView. To tell the truth, Firstly, I created a java file about the recyclerview but I can have a good use of it. You can see it in the code folder. Then I decide to put those structions in the PayCrimeFragment. I created a new imagaview for the picture and put the imageview in the recyclerview, and then the linearlayout is in the PaycrimeFragment relative XML files. For the structre of the recyclerview, The adpter connect with the data and the viewholder is wrapping for each image. The recyclerview display the and managed by layoutmanager.
